# Head First Design Patterns in C++
This repository contains sample code in C++ based on the book, "[Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do)", by Freeman & Robson, published by O'Reilly.

The original sample code in Java, which the book's examples are based on, can be found here: https://github.com/bethrobson/Head-First-Design-Patterns.

This code has been developed as part of a **Book Club** I am running with members of my team.

- Each chapter has its own Xcode project and C++ source files that produce a command line executable.

## Chapters
